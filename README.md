This is my project on Quiz-Webapp.
The main goal was to get some hands-on experience with JavaScript and especially DOM manipulation.
A quiz web app is better than paper and pen because it gives instant results, saves time, and doesnâ€™t waste paper. It also makes quizzes more fun with timers, colors, and feedback, and you can take them anytime on your device.
